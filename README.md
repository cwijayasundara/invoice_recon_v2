We use the Unstructured.io - https://unstructured.io/ to process the semi structured docs:

Install the following system dependencies if they are not already available on your system with e.g. brew install for Mac. 
Depending on what document types you're parsing, you may not need all of these.

- libmagic-dev (filetype detection)
- poppler-utils (images and PDFs)
- tesseract-ocr(images and PDFs)
